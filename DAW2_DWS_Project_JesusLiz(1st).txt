Comments for JesÃºs Liz
----------------------

Mark => 65/100

User Manual => 90/100
-----------
- Quite complete


Technical Manual => 80/100
----------------
- Very complete
- Next manual must keep being thorough and structured. You need to explain the problems you have faced and how you have solved them.
- Besides, you need to explain to me what can I do to see the better points of your work.


Completeness => 83/100
------------
- The template for books and users is not complete
- The logo is not original. Other students have used the same.
- No library parameters


Performance => 0/100
-----------
- session_start is giving a warning. You are sending data before calling it. Then, it can't work! This is an important problem you should have detected before.
- All your pages have this problem. I can't navigate through them... I have had to unset warning display to be able to see your site.
- You need to unset the session cookie when logging out


Smartness => 25/100
---------
- You are using mysql to work with the database (not pdo or mysqli). Remember it is deprecated!
- Why are you using "include_once" and not "require_once" for very important documents?
- You are accessing the db through two (at least) different ways. That's not good.
- The problems with your warnings are bad for this section too.
- On the other hand, your classes structure is promising.
- You are not filtering user information. High risk of injection!
- Your solution for login failure is clearly improvable.


Usability and design => 65/100
--------------------
- A greater part of your work comes from a third party. There's a little part directly created by you. So, I have to be tough.
- A lot of lost space just under the navigation bar (because of the warnings the system is sending)
